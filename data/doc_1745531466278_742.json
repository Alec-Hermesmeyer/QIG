The CMAR acknowledges and agrees that the City is entering into this \r\nContract in reliance on the CMAR's expertise with respect to the performance of the Work. The \r\nProject will serve an essential public service and will be critically important to enable the City to \r\ncontinue to meet its needs and obligations. The CMAR shall perform the Work in accordance \r\nwith the Contract Standards to further the interests of the City and the Project. \r\n3.2 Scope of the Work. The scope of the Work is divided into Preconstruction and \r\nConstruction Phase Services, as more thoroughly described in Exhibit \"B\". The CMAR \r\nrecognizes that, notwithstanding this division, the components of the Work may overlap and \r\nagrees to perform all Work in accordance with the applicable Contract Standards. Except as \r\nauthorized under a CGMP Amendment, in no event will the CMAR commence performance of \r\nany construction prior to the issuance of a Notice to Proceed following the GMP Amendment \r\nDate. \r\n3.3 Information Provided by or on Behalf of the City. The City has procured the services \r\nof the CMAR, for among other reasons, its ability to work with the Design Professional in the \r\ndevelopment of the Project design, not as an Architect or Engineer, but as a construction \r\nmanager and building contractor experienced in the type and scope of construction involved \r\nwith the Project. As such, at certain times or milestones specified by the City, it shall be the \r\nresponsibility of the CMAR to review the drawings and Project Manual, and advise the City of \r\nany error, inconsistency, or omission which was discovered, or which should have been \r\ndiscovered by a reasonably competent construction manager and/or contractor, and to timely \r\nrecommend alternative solutions whenever the  design affects construction feasibility, budget, \r\nrisks, or schedules (all without assuming the Design Consultants' professional responsibility). \r\nConsistent with the scope of these duties, the City makes no representation or warranty with \r\nrespect to any information provided to the CMAR by or on behalf of the City in connection with \r\nthis Contract. The CMAR shall assess all risks related to the Project and independently verify \r\nand confirm all information supplied to it by or on behalf of the City and upon which the CMAR \r\nelects to rely in connection herewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CMAR assumes no liability \r\nfor design errors in documents provided by the City or the Design Consultants. Except as may \r\nreasonably be requested by the CMAR, expressly permitted by this Contract and General \r\nConditions, and provided there is no resulting increase to the GMP or the Contract Time (unless \r\notherwise agreed by the Director in his sole discretion), CMAR shall have no right to relief \r\nhereunder, or to make any claim against the City, or to seek any adjustment to Contract \r\nCompensation or the Contract Times as the result of any error, omission, or insufficiency \r\nrelating to any information provided to the CMAR by or on behalf of the City in connection with \r\nthis Agreement, to the extent such error, omission, or insufficiency should have been identified \r\nby the CMAR during the development of the Construction Documents as part of the duties of the \r\nCMAR hereunder. \r\n3.4 Related Projects. The CMAR acknowledges that the City may undertake other capital \r\nprojects at or near the Project (\"Related Projects\") and agrees to accept the obligations of the \r\nCMAR concerning the Related Projects, as set forth in the General Conditions. Nothing in the \r\nContract Documents shall be interpreted as granting the CMAR exclusive occupancy of the \r\nProject Site. The CMAR must ascertain to its own satisfaction the scope of the Project and the \r\nnature of any other contracts that have been or may be awarded for any Related Project(s). \r\nPage 6 \r\n----------------Page (6) Break----------------\r\nCity of Houston -Houston Airport System \r\nMLIT CMAR CONTRACT \r\n3.5 Responsibility for Personnel and CMAR-Related Entities.

The \r\nCMAR acknowledges that the Preconstruction Services are segregated into discrete tasks \r\nassociated with the advancement of the Preconstruction Services, as identified in Exhibit \"B\", \r\nand that a Notice to Proceed with Preconstruction Services may be limited to certain specifically \r\nidentified tasks. The City will therefore have the right to issue multiple Notices to Proceed with \r\nrespect to Preconstruction Services, identifying the Preconstruction Services tasks to be \r\nperformed by the CMAR. \r\n4.3 Ownership and Use of Work Products. \r\n4.3.1 CMAR conveys and assigns to the City its entire interest and full ownership \r\nworldwide in and to any work, invention,  notes, plans, computations, data bases, \r\ntabulations, exhibits, reports, underlying data, photographs and other work \r\nproducts, and any modifications or improvements to them (collectively \r\n\"Documents\"), and the copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and any \r\nother proprietary rights therein (collectively \"Proprietary Rights\") that CMAR, its \r\nagents, employees, contractors, and Subconsultants (collectively \"Authors\") \r\ndevelop, write, or produce under this Contract (collectively \"Works\"). \r\n4.3.2 The Authors shall not claim or exercise any Proprietary Rights related to the \r\nWorks.

The Parties anticipate that there may be some phases of Construction that are \r\nready for commencement before the GMP Amendment Date. The CMAR may recommend \r\nsuch phases or elements of the Construction (\"Advanced Packages\") to the Director, as \r\nappropriate, during performance of the Preconstruction Phase Services. The Director shall \r\nhave the sole discretion to authorize an Advanced Package pursuant to this Section and \r\nExhibit \"B\" but has no obligation to enter into any CGMP Amendment.

The CMAR, without any increase \r\nin the Preconstruction Phase Services Fee, shall promptly take all necessary rectification action, \r\nmaking multiple re-submittals, if required. \r\n4.6 CGMP Negotiation and Execution. If the Director agrees to authorize the \r\ncommencement of a portion of Construction under a CGMP Submittal, the CMAR and Director \r\nshall negotiate and enter into a CGMP Amendment. A CGMP Amendment at a minimum shall \r\nincorporate and definitively address all of the items identified in Exhibit \"F\", and shall contain \r\nany other commercial terms and conditions specific to the Advanced Package (but shall not \r\nalter the terms and conditions of this Contract). Advanced Packages may be structured in a \r\nmanner that provides for the commencement of the related Construction at any time determined \r\nby the Parties. \r\n4.7 CGMP Amendment. If the Parties mutually agree to the terms of the CGMP Submittal, \r\nfollowing negotiations at the election of the Director in his sole discretion and subject to approval \r\nby the Director, the Parties will enter into the CGMP Amendment and the CGMP Amendment \r\nDate will be established hereunder.

The CMAR, without any increase \r\nin the Preconstruction Phase Services Fee, shall promptly take all necessary rectification action, \r\nmaking multiple re-submittals, if required. \r\n4.11 GMP Amendment. If the Director determines to accept the GMP Submittal, following \r\nnegotiations at the election of the Director in its sole discretion and subject to approval by the \r\nCity Council, the Parties will enter into the GMP Amendment and the GMP Amendment Date \r\nwill be established hereunder and thereupon the Construction Phase shall commence.

The MLIT Program Definition Manual (PDM), dated December 2014, outlines the \r\nProgram background, existing conditions, Program requirements, development plan, \r\nconceptual design criteria and Program phasing to be validated by the Design \r\nConsultant and CMAR. During the Program definition process, the HAS planning team \r\n·generated guidelines and objectives through several sources, including interviews with \r\nHAS staff, workshops, and discussions with airport stakeholders. These sources \r\nguided the planning and subsequent design efforts for the MLIT as documented in the \r\nMLIT PDM. \r\nB. The MLIT design shall address the following key planning objectives as stated in the \r\nMLIT PDM: \r\n1. Provide additional international gate capacity within the Project boundary; \r\n2. Provide a high level of customer service; \r\n3. Meet airline requirements for contact gates and passenger processing facilities; \r\n4. Replace aging infrastructure, ensuring a focus on the maintainability and total \r\ncost of ownership of new assets; \r\n5. ·Develop a terminal facility that utilizes space efficiently; \r\n6. Develop a terminal facility that maximizes concession revenue opportunities; \r\n7. Increase opportunities for non-airline revenue sources; \r\n8. Maximize airside envelope to establish flexible and high gate utilization; and \r\n9. Maintain existing operations and number of wide-body gates during construction \r\nphasing. \r\nC. Additional considerations include the following: \r\n1. Plan for the complete passenger experience from drop-off through customs and \r\nbaggage collection with clear wayfinding and physical flow that enables a simple \r\nand clear operation; \r\n2. Address passenger needs for 24/7 operation that include available concessions, \r\nsleep pods, and comfortable lounge-type seating; \r\n3. Consider pay-per-use club with services that may include a spa with shower \r\nfacility; \r\n4. Connection point between arrivals to the Federal Inspection Services facility \r\nmust be seamless; \r\n5. Design the terminal facility with adequate and functional support for back-of-\r\nhouse operations including maintenance and equipment room space; \r\n6. Plan for concessions logistics -consider how materials and deliveries move \r\nthough the facility from the loading dock to designated spaces, away from the \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 3 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (57) Break----------------\r\nEXHIBIT B \r\npassengers and within a back of house environment; plan for centralized storage \r\nfor concessions; \r\n7. Consolidate operational spaces to support an efficient operation; \r\n8. Design the facility to both integrate art within the terminal design elements and to \r\nconsider placement of art when planning facility interiors; \r\n9. Integrate advertising with the art program; plan for retail and commercial \r\nadvertising to fit within the design; \r\n10. Plan for the modern passenger, including mobile device charging stations; \r\n11. Design for a tight building envelope that is properly sealed with energy efficient \r\nmaterials and glazing; and \r\n12. Consider the passenger's luggage needs to enable unencumbered shopping and \r\nrelaxation. \r\n1.04 INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER RESEARCH \r\nA. To develop a deep understanding of the international customer hierarchy of needs in \r\nsupport of the Project, HAS conducted a series of focus groups to inform a conjoint \r\nanalysis. Focus groups of business and leisure travelers were comprised of both US \r\nresidents traveling internationafly, as well as departing international travelers in the \r\nfollowing regions: Mexico, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. \r\nB. The report describing a list of airport amenities and features to be considered as part \r\nof the Project design will be considered by the Design Consultant during design of the \r\nMLIT. \r\nSECTION 2 -PROJECT DESCRIPTION \r\n2.01 OVERVIEW \r\nA. The new MLIT will replace both existing Terminal C North Pier and the entire Terminal \r\nD facility with a new single consolidated terminal building planned to occupy four \r\nlevels. The south face of the new MLIT will be constructed to the north of the current \r\nbuilding location to accommodate landside roadway improvements. The proposed new \r\nMLIT will be planned for 15 wide-body gates including 4 gates for A380 aircraft, \r\ndepending on the fleet mix, primarily on two double-loaded pier concourses. These \r\ngates will also be able to accommodate up to 30 narrow-body aircraft in alternative \r\nconfigurations. \r\nB. The new MLIT replaces all of the terminal processing functions of existing Terminal D, \r\nwhile expanding capacity and providing the desired passenger amenities and \r\nexperience found in a world class international terminal. The Project includes all the \r\nwork contained within the Project boundary as shown in Attachment A to this Scope \r\nof Services, such as the new MLIT and its associated landside and apron work and \r\nutilities; and connections to other airport facilities, such as terminal processor facilities \r\nat the Federal Inspection Services (FIS) located within Terminal E and connection to \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 4 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (58) Break----------------\r\nEXHIBIT B \r\nTerminal B (Terminal New C North). The Project boundary will vary based on final \r\ndesign of the Terminal and Apron. In addition, provisions will need to be made for \r\nconnection (with a future pedestrian bridge) between the MLIT and an existing parking \r\nstructure over North Terminal Road as well as enabling direct access to a future hotel \r\nthat may be constructed adjacent to the Project. \r\n' \r\nC. Work within the Project boundary, located outside the terminal building, is generally \r\ndefined to include, but not be limited to: \r\n1. Apron pavement systems and associated infrastructure and utilities, including but \r\nnot limited to, grading and storm water drainage, apron lighting, potable water, \r\nsanitary sewer, preconditioned air, ground power, power and communications, \r\npassenger boarding bridges and foundations, and hydrant fueling system from \r\nthe terminal building curtain wall to the tail-of-stand-road (vehicle service road), \r\nincluding the vehicle service road and pavement markings. \r\n2. Hydrant fueling system design from the aircraft fueling hydrants to the NCN \r\nconnection point of the main hydrant fueling system located south of Taxiway NB \r\nand east of NJ. Remaining apron pavement and utilities system design will be \r\nunder a related project. \r\n3. Landside work, extension of the utilities conveyance corridor to the east end of \r\nthe MLIT footprint, and roadway modifications. Landside work includes roadway \r\nmodifications required for improved flow of vehicular traffic in and around the \r\nMLIT, additional curbfront and bypass lanes in front of the  terminal, and new \r\nsignage and wayfinding. The landside project includes development on the \r\nlandside, or public areas, along North Terminal Drive in front of the MLIT \r\nterminal and transition to the NCN terminal, and associated roadway utility work. \r\nThe new MLIT curbfront will be shifted slightly north from the existing Terminal D \r\ncurbfront to create space for new arrivals and departures lanes and curbsides, \r\nwhile reconstruction of the existing roadway will create bypass lanes through this \r\ncongested area. \r\nD. In order to maintain operation of the airport during redevelopment of the MLIT, \r\nconstruction of the Terminal and associated work will need to be phased. Preliminary \r\nconsiderations for Project construction phases are identified below: \r\n1. Enabling Packages -Design Consultant and CMAR shall jointly develop \r\nEnabling Packages to be issued as early procurement (work) packages for \r\nComponent Guaranteed Maximum Price (CGMP) proposals, such as temporary \r\nsterile corridor(s), temporary baggage handling system, hydrant fuel main \r\nextension from NCN tie-in to the tie-in at the existing fuel main, and other \r\nenabling projects identified during the preconstruction period. \r\n2. D1 Pier and Western Terminal Processor and Frontal Gates \r\n3. D2 Pier and Eastern Frontal Gates \r\n4. D3 Pier and Eastern Terminal Processor \r\n[Note that the 03 (East) Pier has been removed and replaced with an eastern \r\napproach far;ade and associated site development. Connection to the FIS must \r\nbe maintained and program requirements within the 03 Pier are to be provided \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 5 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (59) Break----------------\r\nEXHIBIT B \r\nas needed within the 02 Pier. This requirement supersedes the 03 Pier \r\nrequirements as stated in the ML/T POM.] \r\nE. The Project is to be designed with constructability and passenger experience at its \r\ncore. Therefore, the Project must be designed and constructed in multiple phases to \r\nallow continuation of passenger services in the existing terminals, while the existing \r\nTerminal D is decommissioned and demolished in phases. Construction phasing as \r\ndescribed within the MLIT PDM is primarily a west to east flow of construction, where \r\nconstruction does not begin until United Airlines vacates the existing C North Pier \r\nfollowing completion of the new Terminal C North (NCN) Pier. The City is evaluating an \r\noption; however, to accelerate construction by advancing construction of the D2 pier \r\nand constructing the new terminal from east to west. For planning purposes, the intent \r\nis that a minimum of six (6) contact gates remain operational during the MLIT \r\nconstruction, including four (4) positions for wide-body and two (2) positions for A380 \r\naircraft. \r\nF. Each phase of MLIT construction will require design and construction of temporary \r\ninfrastructure to enable construction of the piers while maintaining existing operations \r\nand protecting the passenger experience. Design Consultant in collaboration with the \r\nCMAR will need to address the temporary infrastructure in each phased construction \r\npackage to maintain passenger, landside, airside, airport wide work, utilities \r\ninfrastructure, and Terminal E FIS access and control of sterile corridors. In addition, \r\nlogistics management must be ensured within the MLIT and back-of-house corridors \r\nand building access during each phase of construction. The CMAR will identify \r\nconstruction phasing options that enable efficient Project construction while fully \r\nsatisfying the operational requirements of the airport. The CMAR will collaborate with \r\nthe Design Consultant to ensure that design of the temporary and final facilities \r\nenables maintenance of operations and efficient construction. \r\n2.02 PROGRAMMATIC FUNCTIONS \r\nA. The Project includes international passenger services and support facilities including: \r\nticketing check-in, hold rooms (departure lounges), baggage handling and claim areas, \r\npassenger and baggage screening, passenger amenities, customer service areas, and \r\nnon-airline facility support space. The Project will include, but is not necessarily limited \r\nto, programmatic functions listed below: \r\n1. Ticket Counter and Support Areas \r\n2.

Renovation of Gates C24-C27 and the United Club lounge is United Airlines' \r\nresponsibility, within the NCN Project. Renovation of the two bays of concessions \r\nis the responsibility of this Project. The purpose of maintaining the two bays of \r\nconcessions area is to provide access for United Airlines to and from the NCN to \r\nthe existing C Processor, and to provide vertical circulation service to the apron \r\nlevel. Phased construction of the MLIT will demolish the existing Terminal C \r\nNorth Pier, which serves as the connection between the existing C Processor, \r\nAPM Station and the B-D Connector. For the B-D Connector to have continued \r\naccess to the C Processor and APM station, a temporary pedestrian bridge will \r\nneed to be constructed. The MLIT Design Consultant and CMAR teams will be \r\nresponsible for maintaining this connection. \r\n3. NCN Roadways and Drainage: There will be no new passenger ticketing, \r\nbaggage claim, or curbfronts associated with the NCN project; however, there \r\nwill be phased landside demolition and construction associated with a new \r\nUtilidor and to maintain acceptable vehicle access for terminal and airside \r\nsupport services operations. Landside North Terminal roadways will be \r\ncompletely rebuilt at the end of the program. \r\n4. NCN Apron and Utilities: NCN apron and utilities consist of all the supporting \r\napron and underground utilities associated with the NCN pier concourse. Utilities \r\ninclude the high voltage system, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, domestic water, \r\nfire protection, natural gas, and jet fuel. Design and construction of these \r\nfacilities are the responsibility of United Airlines. The jet fuel main line system, \r\nwhich is in conflict with the NCN project site, will be demolished and rerouted \r\naround the north end of the NCN and extend along the north side of the NCN \r\nProject site and capped within a new vault for future connection to the MLIT \r\nProject.

While sustainability and energy conservation are critical factors in the determination of \r\nsystem design concepts and in the selection of building materials, the City will not seek \r\nthe U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \r\n(LEED ™) certification for the Project. The Design Consultant; however, will be required \r\nto design the Project to include energy and sustainability measures as appropriate to \r\nthe Project for the City's review, using the LEED ™ certification rating system for new \r\nbuilding design and construction as a guide. The City has defined an aspiration that \r\nthe initiatives equivalent to LEED Gold be considered during design and construction, \r\nas well as including the consideration of all sustainable measures, defined as cost \r\neffective in consideration of total cost of ownership of the completed Project. \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 45 of48 \r\n----------------Page (99) Break----------------\r\nEXHIBIT B \r\nB. The Project shall be designed with energy efficient technologies to achieve a \"net zero \r\nenergy building\" such that the new MLIT will consume no additional utilities than the \r\nexisting Terminal D facility. Energy efficiency improvements   associated with the \r\nplanned enabling utilities project will contribute to this objective. \r\nC. The Design Consultant will be expected and required to consider the facility design to \r\nqualify for energy program incentives and then document and request such incentive \r\npayments. The incentive payments received, if any, shall be credited to the City. The \r\nCMAR is responsible for construction of the Project and delivery of appropriate \r\ndocumentation so as to comply with the requirements for the City to obtain the energy \r\nprogram incentives. \r\n10.02 SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PLAN \r\nA. HAS is in the process of developing a Sustainable Management Plan for IAH and \r\nWilliam P. Hobby airports to be prepared in two phases with final completion targeted \r\nJune 2016. \r\n1. Phase 1 will focus on energy and waste reduction/ recycling \r\n2. Phase 2 will focus on water efficiency/ reuse \r\nB. The Phase 1 and 2 Reports will be issued to the selected Proposer, when available. \r\n10.03 LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS \r\nA. The Design Consultant, with input from the CMAR, shall perform Life Cycle Analysis \r\n(LCA) for the Project lifetime period as defined by the PMT (minimum 20-year service \r\nlife) to select design alternatives related to all energy and water consuming devices \r\nand to select materials and finishes for total cost of ownership that reflects overall \r\nbuilding operation and maintenance parameters that are the most cost effective and \r\nsustainable. \r\nB. The Design Consultant is to specify systems that present the best value (in net present \r\nvalue terms) and that demonstrate simple payback of five (5) years or less. \r\nConsideration is to be given to the life-cycle cost (total cost of ownership) of \r\nimplementing technologies, including, but not limited to, the use of renewable energy \r\nsources, in the Project. The technologies to be considered for LCCA include, but are \r\nnot limited to: systems such as HVAC, heat recovery, renewable energy, and variable \r\nair volume; motors and drives; building envelope; lighting; controls; and sustainable \r\nbuilding materials, where feasible. \r\nThe Design Consultant and CMAR are expected to be familiar with economic analyses \r\nrequired to perform LCCA. All LCCA for design alternatives are to be completed no \r\nlater than conclusion of Design Development. \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 46 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (100) Break----------------\r\nEXHIBIT B \r\nATTACHMENT A-\r\nProject Boundary Graphic \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 Page 47 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (101) Break----------------\r\n) \r\n) \r\n) \r\nEXHIBIT 8 \r\nAIRFIELD PROJECT \r\n/ BOUNDARY 1 I-\r\nTorminol C Procouor \r\n** -Current scope boundary based on PDM layout -Subject \r\nto change depending on final design of terminal and apron \r\nMLIT CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK SCOPE OF SERVICES 4/22/2016 \r\n) \r\nMLIT PROJECT BOUNDARY** \r\n(AE AND CMAR) \r\nFIS & Tormittaf E Procossor \r\nPage 48 of 48 \r\n----------------Page (102) Break----------------\r\nCity of Houston -Houston Airport System \r\nMLIT CMAR CONTRACT \r\nExhibit C -General Conditions \r\nEXHIBIT \"C\" \r\nGENERAL CONDITIONS (CMAR) \r\nITRP EDITION \r\nTABLE OF ARTICLES \r\n1.

CMAR may protest in writing any adjustment within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the \r\nadjusted incentive payment. CMAR shall be deemed to have accepted the adjusted incentive payment if \r\nno protest is received by the Director within the 30-day period. \r\n9.13.1.6.3 The Director shall adjust the calculation of any incentive payment for any Nonroad Diesel \r\nEquipment that was on the Project Site for less than thirty (30) calendar days. For example, adjustments \r\nshall be made for eligible equipment that arrives or was not used on the Project Site until after the 1st day \r\nof a month or leaves or is not used on the Project site before the last day of the month. The incentive \r\npayment shall be reduced as follows: \r\na. When the total is seven (7) calendar days or less, the incentive payment rate shall be \r\nmultiplied by 0.1 o. \r\nb. When the total is eight (8) calendar days or more but fifteen (15) calendar days or less, the \r\nincentive payment rate shall be multiplied by 0.25. \r\nc. When the total is sixteen (16) calendar days or more but twenty-two (22) calendar days or \r\nless, the incentive payment rate shall be multiplied by 0.50. \r\nd. When the total is twenty-three (23) calendar days or more but less than the entire month, the \r\nincentive payment rate shall be multiplied by 0. 75. \r\n(Example: A 125 h.p. front-end loader, rated at Tier 2, was used for twenty (20) calendar days on a \r\nproject. The CMAR incentive would be ($0.75 X 125h.p. =$93.75 X 0.50 adj. factor for days of use= \r\n$46.88.) \r\n9.13.1.6.4 The incentive payments under this special provision shall not exceed $20,000. \r\nARTICLE 10-SAFETY PRECAUTIONS \r\n1 0.1 SAFETY PROGRAMS \r\nExhibit C -Page 39 \r\n----------------Page (141) Break----------------\r\nCity of Houston -Houston Airport System \r\nMLIT CMAR CONTRACT \r\nExhibit C -General Conditions \r\n1 0.1.1 CMAR is responsible for initiating, maintaining, and supervising all safety precautions and \r\nprograms in connection with performance of the Contract.

If any \r\nParty's appointed member terminates his or her involvement on the DARB, the \r\naffected Party may nominate a replacement, who shall be appointed to the DARB \r\nunless the other Parties reasonably object to such appointment. Unless the Parties \r\nagree otherwise, each DARB member shall have significant and relevant design or \r\nconstruction experience of large capital improvement projects using relevant project \r\ndelivery methodologies. The members of the DARB shall be selected no later than \r\n90 Calendar Days after CMAR/Design Consultant NTP, whichever is later. \r\n3. The DARB will formulate its own rules of operation, which will be kept flexible to \r\nadapt to changing situations. The EPM, Director, CMAR and Design Consultant will \r\nkeep the DARB informed of construction activity and progress by submitting to the \r\nDARB the monthly progress reports and other relevant data, as appropriate. \r\n4. The DARB may meet as often as circumstances warrant. The DARB initially shall \r\nmeet monthly, until the members become familiar with the Project. If conditions \r\nwarrant, the DARB may increase or decrease the frequency of the meetings to better \r\nserve the Parties and as mutually agreed among the Director, CMAR, Design \r\nConsultant and EPM. \r\n5. Each meeting will consist of an informal round table discussion and, if possible, a \r\nProject site walk. The round table discussion will be attended by representatives \r\nfrom the City, EPM, CMAR, and the Design Consultant, plus appropriate \r\nrepresentatives of their respective Project Teams. The round table discussions shall \r\ninclude presentations from the Director, the EPM, CMAR, and Design Consultant to \r\nthe DARB that may address the following items: \r\na. design and/or construction work accomplished since the last meeting, \r\nb. current status of the work the current and future schedule, \r\nc. payment status, \r\nd.

If a Party desires to \r\nappeal the DARB's decision, the Party must submit a written notice of intent to \r\nappeal to the DARB within seven (7) Days following receipt of the DARB's decision. \r\nIf a Party does not appeal or provide timely notice of its intent to appeal, the DARB's \r\ndecision is final and the Parties shall comply with it. CMAR's and Design \r\nConsultant's compliance with the DARB's final decision is a material duty under this \r\nAgreement, to the extent allowed by law. \r\nC. NON-BINDING MEDIATION \r\n1. For any Eligible Dispute that the DARB is unable to resolve, before initiating any \r\nlitigation or seeking any remedies available at law or in equity, except in an \r\nemergency, the Parties shall mediate, in good faith, as described below. \r\n2. The Parties shall initiate the mediation procedure for Eligible Disputes by providing \r\nwritten notice to the Director, City Attorney, CMAR, Design Consultant, and any other \r\nparty to the Eligible Dispute as described below (\"Mediation Request\"). \r\n3. The Parties shall submit an Eligible Dispute to a neutral, third party mediator chosen \r\nby mutual consent of the Parties. If, within fourteen (14) Days of receipt of a \r\nMediation Request, the Parties cannot agree on a mediator, the City shall choose an \r\nexperienced, neutral, third party mediator, who shall be knowledgeable about design \r\nand construction of large capital improvement projects using relevant project delivery \r\nmethodologies. Mediation shall occur within thirty (30) Days of choosing a mediator, \r\nunless the Parties otherwise agree to a later date. Mediation shall occur in Houston, \r\nTexas, and each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in connection with the \r\nmediation. The Parties shall equally share the costs of the mediator's fees; provided, \r\nhowever, that the Director shall be responsible for issuing to the mediator the full \r\npayment of the mediator's fee, subject to appropriation therefor by the City's \r\ngoverning body. CMAR's pro-rated share of  the mediator's fee shall be deducted \r\nfrom CMAR's payment for performed Work. Design Consultant's pro-rated share of \r\nthe mediator's fee shall be recovered as an offset to the Design Consultant's \r\ncompensation. The resolution of any dispute disposed of by agreement between the \r\nParties during mediation will be reduced to writing within ten (10) Days of resolution \r\n(\"Mediated Resolution\") by the mediator. Compliance with the Mediated Resolution \r\nwill be a material duty under this Agreement, to the extent allowed by law. \r\n4. Any Party may request Non-Binding Mediation of any Eligible Dispute, whether \r\ntechnical or otherwise. Non-Binding Mediation is voluntary and will not be a \r\ncondition precedent to submitting a dispute to the Director. The non-requesting \r\nParty may decline the request in its sole discretion. If there is concurrence that any \r\nparticular matter shall be mediated, the provisions of this Section shall apply. \r\n5. The mediator shall be a professional mutually acceptable to the Parties who has no \r\ncurrent  or on-going relationship to any Party in the mediation. The mediator shall \r\nhave full discretion as to the conduct of the mediation.
